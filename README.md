SCSS mixin for changing icons based on the input font size

This mixin was created to solve problem with using high detailed icons on desktop, and their appearance on mobile devices. 
The goal was to show different icons , but using the same ico font content property 

You need to create/generate different ico fonts family, and icons needs to have the same name and css content property inside every font family. In this example, I used icomoon, but you can use what ever you want :)
